# mixedreg
Mixed non-parametric regression between Kernel and Spline Truncated with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for optimum bandwidths and knots search

Use **indeks.csv** file to specify which independent variables follow _Kernel Regression_ or _Spline Truncated_ 

_Note_: the index minimum value is 1. Add 0 entries to make the number of entries in the first and second columns equal. So that R can read the file correctly
